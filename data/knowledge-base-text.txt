Key Patterns Identified in the JSON

The relevant data can be logically grouped into three main sections:

1️⃣ Identity Data (The Subject)

Address:
Found under identitySourceDocument.addressIdentifiers
Example:
"3039 East Cornwallis RD, Building 002, Durham, United States OF America, 27709"

Unique ID:
The documentId (e.g., a390e4c9-514f-4dc9-8297-707bfbcf8ba8) serves as a unique key for the entire risk profile.

2️⃣ Overall Risk Summary

Profile Score:
An aggregated score (e.g., 0.5) located in profileScoreDetail.

3️⃣ Detailed Risk Findings (The Knowledge Base)

The riskFindings array contains 104 structured risk events, each describing a unique risk item.
These findings are the most valuable for your RAG pipeline.

Each finding includes:

Field	Description
findingText	Core description of the risk (most important content)
riskCategory / riskSubcategory	Type of risk (e.g., Financial, Legal)
priority	Severity level of the finding
findingContext	Additional evidentiary details
🛠️ Constructing Relationships for Vector Embeddings

To maximize retrieval accuracy, create separate, focused text chunks for each risk finding and one overall profile summary — all linked back to the business identity.

1️⃣ Primary Embedding Structure: Detailed Risk Finding (Most Important)

This is the core structure for your RAG pipeline.
Each of the 104 entries in riskFindings should become one individual vector chunk.

Action:
Iterate through each finding and generate one chunk per entry.

Vector DB Field	Data Source (Concatenated Text for Vectorization)	RAG Query Example
Content (Vectorized)	findingText + findingContext + "The source is: " + source	“What are the high-priority regulatory risks for the company?”
Metadata (Filtering)	business_id: documentId	“Show me all risks for this ID.”
Metadata	risk_category: riskCategory	“Filter by Financial.”
Metadata	risk_priority: priority	“Filter by Priority 1.”
Metadata	business_address: Address Line 1	Links content to physical location.

✅ Example Final Text Chunk:

"High severity, legal non-compliance risk: The company was cited for environmental violations in Q2 2025. 
Finding Context: Violation of Clean Water Act, fines pending. 
The source is: EPA Regulatory Filings."

2️⃣ Secondary Embedding Structure: Profile Summary

This captures high-level insights about the entire business —
useful for summary or overview-type RAG queries.

Action:
Create one chunk per document summarizing the profile score and main risk categories.

Vector DB Field	Data Source (Concatenated Text for Vectorization)	RAG Query Example
Content (Vectorized)	"The business profile for [Address] has an overall risk score of [profileScore]. The top three risk areas are [Category 1], [Category 2], and [Category 3]."	“What is the risk score for the company at 3039 E Cornwallis RD?”
Metadata	profile_score: profileScore	Numerical filtering
Metadata	business_id: documentId	Links to detailed findings
✅ Summary

By using both structures, your vector store becomes robust and query-ready:

Structure 1: Deep-dive, evidential RAG for risk analysis

Structure 2: High-level, contextual RAG for summary queries
